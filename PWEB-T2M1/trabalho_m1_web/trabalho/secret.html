                <li>Skinwalker
                    <p class="encyclopedia-text">They eat people and wear their skin, usually hide in the flesh of dead animals and try to get hunters close, but they are most common in city landscapes. They always try to blend in with the environment.</p><br>

                    <li class="encyclopedia-text">Previous information about people. They can and will become your most dearest, learn about your peers and, in case of doubt, have no hesitation and mercy, <strong class="red">they are not here anymore.</strong></li><br>
                    <li class="encyclopedia-text">Manipulation. Try to play into their game and get personal, close enough to put a bullet through, but don't be naive, they are here to feast.</li><br>

                    <p>Recommended weaponry</p><br>
                    <li class="encyclopedia-text">Small calibers, like pistols or revolvers. As they like to disguise, the biggest drawback is the police showing up in a busy town. You will be deemed the culprit of murder, so you want to minimize the probability of first degree murder, and maximize self-defense. Do not stay for long, you will need to flee.</li><br>

                    <li class="encyclopedia-text">Be physically capable, they always put up a fight. Wendigos are agile blood-driven maniacs.</li><br>

                <li>BigFoot
                    <p class="encyclopedia-text">A monster that lives far away into the mountains. Bigfoot has been a mistery for centuries, and no one knows for sure what it is, maybe a non-documented animal with human features, or just an hairy man roaming around in the woods, and every bigfoot sighting ever registered has been met with backlash and deemed as a conspiracy theory</p><br>
